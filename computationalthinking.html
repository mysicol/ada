            <p><b>Charles Babbage</b> was the lead contributor for the mechanical design of the Analytical Engine. So why is <b>Ada Lovelace</b> considered the first computer programmer?</p>
            <p>Ada Lovelace figured out how to use the Analytical Engine to <b>do more than just manipulate numbers</b>. She theorized that you could use the computer to work in more diverse situations, like composing music or even sewing!</p>
            <p><a href="branching.html">Conditional Branching:</a> <br>Choosing between paths based on the answer to a logical question. The Analytical Engine <b>paused</b> between computations to decide what it would do next, and Lovelace realized this could be exploited to complete more involved decision-making processes.</p>
            <p><a href="abstraction.html">Abstractions:</a> <br>Referring to <b>large solutions simply</b> so that we can reuse them in different, <b>unique contexts</b>. This is how computers, which run numerically, can work with other forms of data!</p>
            <p>Since Ada Lovelace was the first to realize the potential for computers to go beyond simple calculations, she is credited with being the <b>first computer scientist.</b></p>
