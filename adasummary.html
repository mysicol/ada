            <p>Ada Lovelace is usually attributed with being the <strong>first computer scientist</strong>. Which is insane, because she lived 30 years prior to the invention of the lightbulb!</p>
            <p>Ada Lovelace's contributions were mainly theoretical. She worked with Charles Babbage to design<strong> the Analytical Engine </strong> - which, although never created, is widely recognized as being the world's first computer.</p>
            <p>That is because the Analytical Engine was<strong> Turing Complete</strong>, meaning it had important capabilities like
                <strong>abstraction</strong>
            and
            <strong>branching reasoning</strong>
            which made it as powerful as a modern-day computer.</p>
